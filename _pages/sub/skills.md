# Project

- **Intelligent Data Analysis Assistant**: Language interactive data analysis assistant product, including checking indicators, finding tables, generating SQL, interpreting data, table understanding, dialogue system, and intelligent Q&A functions.
	- 1) Intelligent Agent Architecture Construction: From Theory to the Ground: Based on the human cognitive architecture, OlaGPT is proposed to simulate the human cognitive pattern, which improves the reasoning ability by up to 85 percent(https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pb8aIkda9IMAKeE36qgpEQ). Extending the entire Agent architecture to data analytics, the overall accuracy is 70%+.
	- 2) Text2SQL‑agent construction: The workflow paradigm based on the decomposition‑promoting attention concept effectively improves the text2SQL task based on LLM. On the engineering side, the use of information recall ranking, understanding optimization, RAG, SQL generation, and SQL correction helps to increase the landing perception rate from 24% to over 85%. On the research side, compared with Spider Dev, Spider‑Realistic, and Bird datasets, it has increased by about 2‑3 percentage points. The related paper was published in 2024‑ACL‑Findings.
	- 3) Text2SQL‑agent construction based on model collaboration: By adopting a collaborative approach with various models, an accuracy rate of up to 65.58% (top 2) has been achieved on brid‑dev. Currently, the results are being organized and submitted for ranking.
	- 4) Establishing SQL‑related application ecosystem: Building agent functions such as SQL error correction, SQL Optimization SQL Q&A, SQL explanation, etc., with a high perceptual rate of 85%+
